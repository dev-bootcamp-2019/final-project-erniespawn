## Avoiding Common Attacks



### Owner Profile 
The constructor initializes the owner's profile using their address so in case something goes wrong one can kill the contract and remove it from the blockchain with all the funds remaining safe.


### Bugs 
In case any bugs are detected in the contract, we can freeze the contract and fix them without incorporating heavy damage while the bug is being fixed.


### Contract lifecycle
Owner of the contract can terminate the contract using kill-function, that removes the code from blockchain and return funds.
